# js_password-generator

For this challenge the developer was asked to create a password generator that would give the user the option to include four different criteria for their randomized password. The developer had to use a combination of javascript tools incuding alerts, prompts and confirmations in order to first gather information from the user to cue the generator to create randomized passwords based on character pools.
